Linked List Advantages/Disadvantages

Advantages: The linked list allows for memory to be dynamically allocated, so in the instance of creating a list of commands
    there is a virtually limitless amount of commands that could be added to the list and the memory allocated is always at a minimum.

Disadvantages: Because the list only has a member function pointing to the head node, the list must be iteratively tranversed which can take 
    a long time if the list becomes too large.

Array Advantages/Disadvantages

Advantages: It is very easy to traverse the array for a specific element because each element is associated with an index number and the
    time needed to find an element remains constant regardless of the size of the array.

Disadvantages: The memory of an array is not dynamic and must be allocated once when it is created, leaving little flexibility if a dataset exceeds the
    of the array. And when the data stored doesn't completely fill the array, there is allocated memory that is unused.
