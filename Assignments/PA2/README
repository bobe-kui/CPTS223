1. Does maching processing power affect execution time?
    Machine processing power does affect execution time because more powerful machines will be able to execute individual tasks faster, 
    which is why it is important when comparing algorithms to compare the amount of operations in an algorithm rather than time.

2. Which performs better: std::list or std::vector? Under what conditions?
    List performs better than vector, especially as the number of inputs increases to a large amount.
