In this PA, hash tables were used to sort the items by ID and by category. 

Insertion sort and merge sort were used to sort the items. 

For a smaller data set such as the category Puzzles, the times are faster for insertion sort.

For a larger data set such as the category Toys & Games, the times are faster for merge sort.
